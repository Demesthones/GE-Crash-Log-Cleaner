# GE-Crash-Log-Cleaner
Deletes the crashlog folder for all users created by GE Centricity using Citrix.

For use, just run the .jar file.  It will create the sample ini also included.
Change your basedir to where your xenprofile profiles are stored.
Change targetdir to where you want the backups to be stored.

There's no indication that it's doing anything currently so just let it run.  It may take a while if you have a lot of users.
